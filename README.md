Feature Engineering  and  Predictive Modelling

Aim:
To analyze data spanning a 15-year time frame across various financial indices to understand the interplay of global financial markets.

Research Questions:
This project addresses the following key questions:

Impact of Currency Fluctuations:
1) How is the performance of the S&P 500 and NASDAQ affected by changes in the US Dollar Index?


Interest Rate Influences:
2) How do changes in Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rates, the LIBOR index, the yield of the US 10-Year Bond, and the SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) influence the NASDAQ Composite Index performance?


Cryptocurrency and Stock Market Dynamics:
3) What are the relationships among the S&P 500, NASDAQ, Bitcoin (BTC) prices, and the Crypto 10 Index, and how do fluctuations in trading volumes impact these relationships?

Precious Metals and Investor Sentiment:
4) How do shifts in the prices of precious metals like gold and silver correlate with investor sentiment in the context of the S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite Index? Are there recurring patterns in these relationships?


Global Stock Market Interconnections:
5) What is the relationship between the performance of stock markets in India, the US, Europe, China, Japan, and Singapore, and how has this relationship evolved over the past 15 years?


Commodity Price Influences:
6) How do fluctuations in the US Dollar Index, US stock prices, and changes in inflation rates affect the performance of natural gas prices and the prices of gold, silver, and crude oil in global markets over the last 15 years?
